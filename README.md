# Loan-Default-Classification
machine learning model to predict the probability that a loan will default


The problem is defined in the classification framework, where the predicted variable is “Charge-Off ”. A charge-off is a debt that a creditor has given up trying to collect on after you’ve missed payments for several months. The predicted variable takes value 1 in case of charge-off and 0 otherwise.
